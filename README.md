# Static Node.js and Express Site
## **Grade:** :heavy_check_mark: Exceeds Expectations
### **Premise** 
>In this project, you'll create a gorgeous portfolio site to showcase the great projects you've built. The site will contain a modern landing page, an about page where you'll have a chance to share contact info, practice your elevator pitch and talk a little about yourself, and a series of project pages to show off and detail at least your first five projects from this Techdegree.

>You'll create a JSON file to store all the data about the projects you've created.

>You'll use Pug to complete provided templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.

>You'll use Node.js and Express to:

 - >Import the required dependencies
 - >Link the JSON with the Pug templates
 - >Set up routes to handle requests
 - >Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
 - >Handle errors
 - >Set up a server to serve the project
### **Project Instructions**
1. Initialize your project
2. Add your dependencies
3. Handle files and folders that shouldn't be stored in your repo
4. Images
   - Create an images folder in your directory to store your images.
   - Add a profile pic of yourself that you would feel comfortable sharing with potential employers. It should present well at 550px by 350px.
   - Take screenshots of your projects. You will need at least two screenshots for each project.
5. Add your project data to your directory
   - #### Reviewer Comments:
   - > Smart data setup. You've created a JSON file, named it data.json, added all the necessary properties and values, and formatted it correctly.
6. Setup your server, routes and middleware
   - #### Reviewer Comments:
   - > Bravo for getting all of your routes in order and displaying the appropriate pages.
7. Handle errors
8. Complete your Pug files
9. Add good code comments
10. Check for cross-browser consistency
### Extra Credit
1. Customize the package.json file
   - #### Reviewer Comments:
   - > Wow! Way to get your app set up correctly and go the extra mile to customize your .gitignore and package.json file.
2. Use error handling middleware to render a Pug template
   - #### Reviewer Comments:
   - > Sweet! Your Pug templates appear to be dialed in and up to the requirements. And you even created an error.pug file. That's so cool! Way to take the initiative!
   - > Bravo for adding an error.pug file that displays when the app is pointed at a non-existent route.
3. Customize the style
   - #### Reviewer Comments:
   - > Nice! Layout looks great and matches the mockups. And your personal touches are dynamite!
### Overall Comments
> Great work!

> You've nailed it!

> There are a couple things you'll want to do to take the project to the next level. The first one would be to grab a spell check plugin for your editor. There are a few typos such as the "Oops" in your 404 page.

> Another is to give your code some breathing room. Use spacing between your functions will make your code much easier to read and follow. You'll be working on a team as a professional dev. Code readability is incredibly important.

> Keep up the great work!
